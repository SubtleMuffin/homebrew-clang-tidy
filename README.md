# Contributing

As of now I do not have a working `Github Actions - Release - Pull Request` chain to automate this repo. If you

1. find such template, please let me know
2. would like to contribute to the bottles, please create a PR with the outputs of `brew bottle subtlemuffin/formulas/clang-tidy` and upload the generated bottles.
